# Summary

The Geothermal VOI App reveals which data types best distinguish between a 
geothermal resource (positive) and an absence of a geothermal resource (negative). This can 
represent various types of geothermal resources; the App was originally designed for 
and provides examples hidden geothermal resources. Hidden geothermal resources that do not show any evidence
of existence on the surface, thus geophysical and geological observations 
are used to make estimates of subsurface conditions. The VOI App, however, also includes 
economics for both heating and cooling and power production projects from [@beckers_geophires_2019], 
and has been demonstrated for enhanced geothermal exploration projects [@trainor-guitton_2025].

The value of information (VOI) metric attempts to quantify how useful specific information types are
by quantifying their reliability and how it may help or hinder with decisions [@howard_information_1966]. 
VOI is from the field of decision analysis and assess if the information will
improve the average outcome of a decision made under uncertainty, like
developing a hidden geothermal resource. As is true for many subsurface decisions (e.g. groundwater,
oil and gas, mining), many of the the data layers are direct evidence of the decision parameters. For exploration geothermal,
we are interested indentifying heat, permeability and fluids, therefore, often times, the data layers are imperfect indicators [@faulds_discovering_2015].

# Statement of need

Many geoscientists working in geothermal do not actively code and those outside 
of oil and gas are not familiar with decision analysis. This VOI Streamlit 
App allows geoscientists to visualize the distribution of their data and calculate
the value of imperfect (field) data simply by upload two comma-seperated value (.csv) files. 
These two files represent calibrated data set: data assosciated with a positive and negative hidden geothermal
 sites, respectively. It is challenging to produce many labeled data sets for earth problems as described in [@trainor-guitton_value_2014] and [@trainor-guitton_value_2020]

# Mathematics

Decision Analysis requires an analysis of the expected outcome (e.g. weighted average) 
of the decision without further information. This uses the probabilities of positive $Pr(\Theta = positive)$ and negative $Pr(\Theta = negative)$
hidden geothermal as the weights multiplied by the value outcomes: $v_a(\Theta = \theta_i)$, the values input into the two by two table that typically represent dollar amounts.  <br />
 $V_{prior} = \max\limits_a \sum_i^2 Pr(\Theta = \theta_i) v_a(\Theta = \theta_i)$
<!-- The prior probability $Pr(\Theta = \theta_i)$ where there are two $\theta_i)$:  $i ={negative, positve}$ -->
Also calculated is the Value with Perfect Information:  <br />
 $V_{perfect} = \sum_i^2 Pr(\Theta = \theta_i) \max\limits_a v_a(\Theta = \theta_i)$
  <!-- \Sigma_{i=1}^2 Pr(\Theta = \theta_i) \max\limits_a v_a(\theta_i) \ \  \forall a  -->
comparing to $V_{prior}$ gives an upper bound on what *any* information could bring or the value *of* perfect information ($VOI_{perfect}$): \
$VOI_{perfect} = V_{perfect}- V_{prior}$

After the .csv files are uploaded, the code base performs a grid search on bin sizes ($x_j$) or kde bandwidths, as documented in @trainor-guitton_voi_2023. To determine the "best" bandwidth, the data are split into training and testing sets, and the accuracy of Na誰ve Bayes classifier is evaluated . The grid search performs the Na誰ve Bayes classification for 20 different bandwidths then compares the predicted class with the true class.  The bandwidth that results in the highest accuracy in Na誰ve Bayes is deemed the ideal bandwidth.

Next, the VOI App calculates the posterior probability: 
<!-- Double dollars make self-standing equations: -->
$$Pr( \Theta = \theta_i | X =x_j ) = \frac{Pr(\Theta = \theta_i ) 
Pr( X=x_j | \Theta = \theta_i )}{Pr (X=x_j)}$$ \
which scales the "ideal" likelihood from the grid search with the user-entered prior probability of success ($\Theta = \theta_i$).
The posterior replaces the prior to become the weight in the value *with* imperfect information: \
$V_{imperfect} = \sum_{j=1}^2 Pr(X = x_j) \max_a \sum_{i=1}^2  Pr(\Theta = \theta_i | X=x_j)  v_a(\Theta = \theta_i)$

comparing to $V_{prior}$ gives an upper bound on what *any* information could bring or the value *of* perfect information ($VOI_{perfect}$): \
$VOI_{perfect} = V_{perfect}- V_{prior}$

This value tells user the ceiling of worth for this data attribute, given the economics and prior probability entered, and the reliability of the data to discriminate between a positive and negative geothermal case.

# Example Output 
The demo problem allows users to build intuition on how $V_{prior}$ and $V_{perfect}$.

This figure provides a visual example of the empirical likelihood (bars) of the electrical conductivity assosciated with positive sites (green) and negative sites (red): 
![Likelihoods of Electrical Conductivity of Lower Crust for INGENIOUS area.\label{fig:Likelihood_CondLowCrust}](Likelihood_CondLowCrust.png)


The continuous lines in the above figure are the fitted kde likelihoods of the optimal bandwidth given the grid search for accuracy in Na誰ve Bayes. 

The likelihood scaled to a prior probability of success ($Pr(\Theta = positive$)=0.2) is given below
![Prior-Scaled Likelihoods of Electrical Conductivity of Lower Crust for INGENIOUS area.\label{fig:Scaled20Likelihood_CondLowCrust}](Scaled20Likelihood_CondLowCrust.png)


The posterior plot of $Pr(\Theta = positive$)=0.2 for a specific feature are shown below
![Posterior of Electrical Conductivity of Lower Crust for INGENIOUS area.\label{fig:Posterior_Prior20}](Posterior_Prior20.png)
This plot shows, given any of the conductivity bin values are observed, how likely are you in a positive (green) versus negative (red) hidden geothermal resource. In general, electrical conductivities of lower crust less than 4.5 (S-m) are more likely to be a negative geothermal site, whereas greater than 4.75 S-m the calibrated dataset show $Pr(\Theta = positive)$= 100%.
