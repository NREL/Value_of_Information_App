	abstract = {The Great Basin currently hosts {\textasciitilde}24 geothermal power plants with more than 600 MW of capacity, but estimates suggest that the region is capable of producing much greater amounts of geothermal energy. Recent studies indicate that a combination of geological, geochemical, and geophysical features characterize the most robust geothermal systems. Considering that most of the geothermal resources in this region are blind, it is imperative that the favorable characteristics for geothermal activity be synthesized and techniques perfected for the discovery of new viable systems. We therefore utilized a multi-disciplinary approach and synthesized 9 geologic, geochemical, and geophysical parameters to produce a new detailed geothermal play fairway map of a large transect across the Great Basin region (96,000 km2) from west-central to eastern Nevada, with the primary objective of facilitating discovery of commercialgrade, blind geothermal fields (i.e. systems with no surface hot springs or fumaroles). Our analysis included: 1) structural settings (i.e., patterns of faulting), 2) age of recent faulting, 3) slip rates on recent faults, 4) regional-scale strain rates, 5) the tendency of faults to slip or dilate based on their orientation in the regional stress field, 6) earthquake density, 7) gravity data, 8) temperature at 3 km depth, and 9) geochemistry from springs and wells. These parameters were grouped into subsets to delineate rankings for local permeability, regional permeability, and heat, which collectively defined the geothermal play fairways (i.e., most likely locations for significant geothermal fluid flow). A major challenge was developing appropriate weightings of individual data types to best predict permeability and overall geothermal potential. Rigorous statistical methods, utilizing 34 benchmarks of known relatively high-temperature ({\textgreater}130{\textdegree}C) geothermal systems in the region, were employed to determine the hierarchal weights of each parameter. The new geothermal potential maps will help to reduce the risks in prospecting for new geothermal systems throughout the reg},

	abstract = {The value of information (VOI) metric requires geophysicists to clearly link their measurements to important subsurface parameters in geothermal exploration, such as temperature, permeability, and fluid information. The metric quantifies the increase in the expected (average) value outcome of a decision. The decision is made with a certain type of additional information, compared to if the decision was made without the information. VOI has challenges that are similar to those faced by machine learning enthusiasts. Labeled data sets are needed in which the labels are the decision variables and the features are the geophysical observables. This paper presents three examples of how the statistical relationship, or reliability, may be calculated for geothermal exploration applications. VOI provides a way to document successes and identify opportunities for improvement in derisking geothermal prospecting with geophysical information.},
